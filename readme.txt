Key Business Questions:
What are the total sales over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly)?
Which products -and product lines are the top performers in terms of sales?
What is the distribution of order status?

Who are the top customers based on sales volume?
What is the geographical distribution of sales?
What are the trends in deal sizes over time?
How does the average sales price per unit vary across product lines?
Which territories contribute the most to sales?
Visualizations:

Line Chart showing total sales by month, quarter, and year.
Top Performing Products:

Bar Chart showing sales by product and product line.
Pie Chart showing sales distribution by product line.

Project Plan:
Data Preparation:

Import the data into Power BI.
Clean the data (handle missing values, data types).
Create necessary calculated columns and measures.
Data Exploration:

Explore the data to understand its structure and contents.
Perform initial analysis to identify any data issues.
Data Modeling:

Create relationships between tables if necessary.
Develop a data model that supports the required analysis.
Visualization Development:

Create the visualizations listed above.
Arrange the visuals on a dashboard layout.
Add slicers for filtering data (e.g., by year, product line, territory).
Interactivity and Usability:

Add interactivity features such as drill-throughs, tooltips, and bookmarks.
Ensure the dashboard is user-friendly and provides clear insights.
Review and Iterate:

Review the dashboard with stakeholders (or peers).
Iterate based on feedback to improve the dashboard.
Finalization:

Finalize the dashboard design.
Prepare a summary report or presentation highlighting key insights.
Deliverables:
